## Solution Overview

To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the maximum score achievable at each hole for a given number of moves. The key idea is to:

- Represent the game board as a graph.
- Use DP to store the maximum score that can be achieved at each hole with a specific number of moves.
- Update the DP table by considering all possible transitions (moves) and taking into account the possibility of resetting to the starting hole from Weayaya holes without consuming a move.

## Detailed Explanation

### Data Structures

- **Adjacency List**: Store the graph as an adjacency list `adj`, where `adj[u]` contains all outgoing canals from hole `u`.
- **Weayaya Holes**: An array `isWeayaya` to keep track of holes with no outgoing canals.
- **DP Table**: A 2D array `dp[n][k+1]` where `dp[u][step]` represents the maximum score achievable at hole `u` using exactly `step` moves.

### Steps

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, `x`, and `k`.
   - Build the adjacency list `adj`.
   - Identify Weayaya holes and store them in `isWeayaya`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the DP table with `LLONG_MIN` (representing impossible states).
   - Set `dp[0][0] = 0`, since we start at hole `0` with `0` moves and `0` score.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Iterate over the number of moves `step` from `0` to `k-1`.
   - For each hole `u`:
     - If `dp[u][step]` is not `LLONG_MIN`, we can consider moves from `u`.
     - For each canal `(u, v)`:
       - Update `dp[v][step + 1]` if a better score can be achieved.
   - **Processing Weayaya Holes**:
     - After each move, check if we can reset from any Weayaya hole back to the starting hole.
     - Since resetting is a free action, we can update `dp[0][step]` with the maximum score from Weayaya holes at the same number of moves.

4. **Finding the Minimum Moves**:
   - After filling the DP table, iterate over the number of moves to find the minimum `step` where the score is at least `x`.
   - If such a `step` is found within `k` moves, output the minimum number of moves.
   - Otherwise, output `"Impossible"`.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- **Multiple Canals Between Holes**: The code handles multiple canals between the same pair of holes.
- **Self-Loops**: The code allows for canals where `u == v`.
- **Scoring the Same Canal Multiple Times**: As per the game rules, the same canal can be scored multiple times.
