To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we'll follow these steps for each test case:

1. **Generate All Valid Intervals:**
   - Use a two-pointer or sliding window approach to find all intervals where the sum of the defense values equals `k`. Since all defense values are positive integers, this can be done efficiently in O(n) time per test case.
   - Store each valid interval with its start and end positions and the length (number of defenders attacked).

2. **Sort the Intervals:**
   - Sort the list of valid intervals by their end positions. This is crucial for efficiently finding non-overlapping intervals.

3. **Compute the Compatibility Array (`p`):**
   - For each interval `i` in the sorted list, find the last interval `j` before `i` that does not overlap with `i`. This can be done using a binary search because the intervals are sorted by end positions.
   - Store `p[i] = index of the last non-overlapping interval before i`.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Initialize a DP table `dp[i][k]` where:
     - `dp[i][k]` represents the maximum total length of attacked defenders using at most `k` intervals among the first `i` intervals.
   - The DP recurrence is:
     ```
     dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k], dp[p[i]][k-1] + length_i)
     ```
     - If we don't include interval `i`, `dp[i][k]` remains `dp[i-1][k]`.
     - If we include interval `i`, we add its length to `dp[p[i]][k-1]`.
   - Iterate over all intervals and all possible number of intervals up to `m`.

5. **Retrieve the Answer:**
   - After filling the DP table, the answer is the maximum `dp[N][k]` for all `k` from 1 to `m`, where `N` is the total number of valid intervals.
   - If no intervals sum to `k` (i.e., `N = 0`), output `"fail"`.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Finding all valid intervals: O(n)
  - Sorting intervals: O(n log n)
  - Computing `p[i]` for all intervals: O(n log n)
  - Dynamic Programming: O(N * m)
  - Total per test case: O(n log n + N * m), acceptable for the given constraints.
