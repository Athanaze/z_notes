 In particular, we want to be able to carry out the
following two operations efficiently: (1) removing a weight, and (2) finding the heaviest weight
which is still at most s[i].
Fortunately for us, there is a data structure in the C++ STL that can do both of these things
efficiently: std::multiset. Both removing elements and answering queries of the form in (2)
takes O(log N) time in a std::multiset with N elements.

# Get max element of vector:

 *std::max_element(occs.begin(), occs.end())

# When searching a value think about order, and binary search if applicable ðŸ§ 

# Connected components sizes

```

// Find connected components
    std::vector<int> component_map(n);
    int num_components = boost::connected_components(
        G, boost::make_iterator_property_map(component_map.begin(), boost::get(boost::vertex_index, G)));

    // Count the size of each connected component
    std::vector<int> component_sizes(num_components, 0);
    for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
        component_sizes[component_map[i]]++;
    }

    // Find the maximum component size
    int max_size = *std::max_element(component_sizes.begin(), component_sizes.end());

```
